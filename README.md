The project utilizes SQLite as its database, offering a lightweight, yet efficient solution for data management.

## Setup Process

### Environment Setup

- **Python 3.10 Installation**: The project is built on Python 3.10 to leverage the latest language features and ensure compatibility.
- **Virtual Environment**: A virtual environment was created to manage project dependencies separately from the system-wide Python installation, maintaining a clean development space.

### Django and Dependencies

- **Django Framework**: Utilizing the Django framework for its robust web development capabilities, Vidly benefits from Django's scalability and extensive library support.
- **Dependency Management**: Critical dependencies, such as `whitenoise` for static file handling and `tastypie` for RESTful API integration, were installed and configured to enhance the application's functionality.

### Configuration and Development

- **Project Configuration**: Initial setup using Django's `startproject` and `startapp` commands laid the groundwork for the application's development.
- **Database Migrations**: Leveraging Django's ORM and migration system, database models were defined and managed effectively to support the application's data structure. SQLite was chosen for its simplicity and ease of integration with Django.

## Core Features

### Admin Webpage

- **User Authentication**: Secure authentication mechanisms allow administrators to log in and access the management dashboard.
- **Content Management**: The admin page provides comprehensive tools for managing movies, props, genres, and availability, all through an intuitive interface.

### Customer Front Page

- **Movie and Prop Catalog**: Customers can explore a detailed catalog of movies and props, complete with descriptions, images, genres, and availability information.
- **Search and Filtering**: Advanced search and filtering capabilities enable customers to easily find content that matches their interests.

## Conclusion

As a student project, Vidly serves as a practical demonstration of applying modern web development techniques in a real-world application. This project showcases the potential of Django and Python in creating feature-rich web applications, while also serving as an invaluable learning tool for web development students. The choice of SQLite for database management underscores the project's commitment to simplicity and efficiency, making it an ideal learning platform for those new to web development.
